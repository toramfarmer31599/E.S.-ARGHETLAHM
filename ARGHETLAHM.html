  <p>GUILD HISTORY</p>
 
 </div><!--guildinfo-->



 <div id="infotext" class="large-10 column">

 <p>A neophyte player was randomly invited to a dead guild at the end of February 2017. The guild was a mere level 5 that had 20 inactive players which included it's own guild leaders. A week has passed without anybody logging in at all… 
<br>
<br>
One evening, The golden crown was passed on to her… along with the responsibilities that the crown embodies… 
<br>
<br>
The guild was finally abandoned… by its former masters… 
<br>
<br>
Having no experience in handling a guild and being a new player as she was, she had all the right to escape such a burden. But unlike the guild's former leaders, She persevered and decided not to give up. 
<br>
<br>
The very first person that she invited was the one whom she trusted the most and together they slowly built the guild's level till the guild bar became accessible. She then started inviting all of those in her very small friends' list as new members. 
<br>
<br>
The new Guild Master was hands on and did everything to please new members. It was a heavy responsibility… yet it was something that she faced bravely because she wasn't alone anymore. There were those who stood by her side despite difficulties. 
<br>
<br>
The guild's members grew in numbers… yet it also faced difficulties and suffered nasty rumors due to it's former members before the neophyte Guild Master handled its affairs. 
<br>
<br>
It was then christened as "Arghetlahm" to embody the values and visions of all it's members that hailed from nations all throughout the world.
